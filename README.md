# Generative Red Team 2 Blog

To add a blog post write a markdown document in `_posts` and issue a PR against this repo once it's done. It needs a filename `YYYY-MM-DD-NAME.md` and the following header at the top of the file: 

```markdown

layout: post
title: AI Village Announcing Generative Red Team 2 at DEF CON 32
author: AI Village, Sven Cattell
date: 2024-06-10 09:00:00 +0900
category: "core"

```

The category should be one of:

1. `core` reserved for core documents like rubric
2. `participant` For participants! If you competed we want to hear from you as a participant.
3. `opinion` for opinions and ideas about disclosure, evaluations, or other aspects of the GRT.
4. `creator` Feedback from creators who helped organize the event.

There's a google form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeC-n23Wi8egI9phXCGHKDrKorcq7LmVrzAPlCxYRWj_ajiWw/viewform?usp=sf_link) if you want to fill that out instead of forking this repo and making a PR.
